Patterer is an online publication from [Benson Kitia](https://twitter.com/bensonkitia) covering industry & big tech, politics, and their intersections.

I believe strongly in the principles of [open-source software](https://opensource.dev). Patterer is built on open-source code and technologies and is entirely open-source itself, meaning anyone can [view this site's code on Github](https://github.com/PattererNet/patterer.net) and use the code however they please with little restriction.
